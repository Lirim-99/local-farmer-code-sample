# local-farmer-code-sample

Description:

I have been working for a client as a MERN stack developer. 
This repository was created only to share one of my code files that I'm proud for.

In the file that I have shared, I'm using Mapbox to show the products on the map and based on the category of the product the image of the product will be different. 
The products on the map can be filtered but the logic on the filtering based on price or city are on the other file.
